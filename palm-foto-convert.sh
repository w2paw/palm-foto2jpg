# evoke with a single file name:

#     palm-foto-convert.sh /filename/

#  This quick and dirty script does a sha1 hash, checks to see if it's a new 
#+ photo, and if so copies to import directory; converts the .jpg.pdb format to
#+ just a plain .jpg; does some tricky stuff with `exiftool` to add/revise the
#+ photo date into a date derived from the filename; adds the hash and original
#+ filename to the growing hash file; and then finally deletes the working
#+ *copy* of the original file - at no time is the original file moved or
#+ touched. 

#  The program should exit immedatly if something goes wrong: filename isn't a 
#+ good match, not allowd to read file, etc. Useful error messages should be 
#+ printed to stderr

# Or at least that's the plan.
